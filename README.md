# Revanced Build
This repo template will allow one to build ReVanced automatically. Set it up to run periodically using cron.

## Notes
- The script will download the **automatically selected compatible version** (using compatibility of patches as listed [here](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches#list-of-available-patches)) of Youtube on APKMirror, **NOT** latest official version on Google Play.
- Under **NO CIRCUMSTANCES** any APKs will be uploaded to this repository to avoid DMCA.

## Customize your build
If you wish to continue with the default settings, you may skip this step.

By default this will build ReVanced with ALL available patches. Follow [this guide](PATCHES_GUIDE.md) to exclude/customizing patches for your build.
